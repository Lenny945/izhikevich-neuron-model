# Izhikevich Neuron Model

Implementation and simulation of the **Izhikevich spiking neuron model** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
Developed as part of the *Redes Neuronales* course at the **Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba (Argentina)**.

---

##  Overview

This notebook demonstrates how the Izhikevich neuron model can reproduce diverse spiking behaviors observed in biological neurons, combining **computational efficiency** and **biological realism**.

The simulation explores how different parameters affect firing patterns and membrane potential dynamics.

---

##  Features

- Full Python implementation of the Izhikevich equations.
- Adjustable model parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to reproduce neuron types.
- Time evolution plots of membrane potential and recovery variable.
- Jupyter-based visualization for experimentation.
